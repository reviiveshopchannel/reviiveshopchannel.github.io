        <h2>Well, idk how you got here but Reviive Shop Channel has been dead since 2024.</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Want to see an ACTUAL Wii Shop Revival that actually has downloads, is way faster then reviive or rii shop, and has lasted way longer then any other revival?</h4>
        <a href="https://wiimart.org">Check out WiiMart</a><p> What is WiiMart? - WiiMart is an open-source revival for the defunct Wii Shop Channel service. It was closed on January 30, 2019, making an entire library of digital-exclusive games get left behind. WiiMart brings back the experience of downloading and playing these titles with a revival of the Wii Shop Channel.</p>
